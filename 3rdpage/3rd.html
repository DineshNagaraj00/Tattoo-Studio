        <p>In the tattoo business, being a good tattoo artist calls for a lot of skill and commitment to giving utterly <br>
            the best kind of art which can rival others. The fact of the matter is, not everyone can become exceptional <br>
            tattoo artists. The ones that have already made it in the business, such names as Carolina Mansur, <br>
            Rob Goodkind, and Tim Derose, have that something that makes them each tick and become the best <br>
            that they are. So don’t let anyone fool you that desire alone is all that you need to get in the game. <br>
            That said, what makes us stand out from the rest?</p>

            <h1>WE HAVE A DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF ART</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="parag">
            <p>Tattoo artists must have a clear and deep understanding not to mention an appreciation of art. <br>
                That is the reason they are called artists. Having an understanding of art goes hand in hand with <br>
                passion and talent (skill). Having these traits will give you the ability to pull off incredible ink art. <br>
                However, as much as you have the skill to be on the pedestal of success, learning about art takes <br>
                time, patience and practice.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="paragr">
            <p>You especially need to have a sound and creative mind and couple this with putting down your <br>
                sketches on paper trying to make it as unique and appealing as possible. Some artists go to such <br> 
                extents of sculpting out their ideas into physical 3D models to portray a clear design. If you take <br>
                up the challenge of learning about art, you can do frequent research from different books or take <br>
                art classes to start you off. In good time, you just might be able to ink skin perfectly just as we do.</p>

    <h1>KEEN ATTENTION TO DETAIL</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            <p>Professional tattooing entails attention to detail, and a great artist keeps into <br>
                account all the details that are especially in the art. They pre-sketches his <br>
                design prior to the actual session and makes sure that all the required <br>
                details are included in the design and to avoid misapplication and smudging <br>
                of colors. Maintaining close attention to detail also means that you mix your <br>
                inks well, adhere to the procedures that safeguard the customer’s hygiene <br>
                and wellbeing plus a lot more where this comes from. Being a good tattoo <br>
                artist means that even if you have hundreds of customers who are ever <br>
                waiting in line for your service, you can still maintain absolute and undivided attention.</p>
